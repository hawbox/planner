# Digital planner

This is a simple planner made for use in Notability on my iPad. The yearly/monthly/weekly pages are hyperlinked for easy navigating. There are two "habit trackers" on each weekly page, which can be omitted by regenerating the pdf with `\newcommand{\trackers}{no}` instead of `yes`. There is space for both monthly and weekly notes, and space to make a yearly plan on the first page. It should work for future years as well by changing the `calYear` command. It is sized for my iPad Air so may need some finagling for other tablets or programs.
